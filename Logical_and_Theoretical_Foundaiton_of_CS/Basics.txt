1. Equivalence relation
**********************
In mathematics, an equivalence relation is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. The relation "is equal to" is the canonical example of an equivalence relation, where for any objects a, b, and c:
a = a (reflexive property),
if a = b then b = a (symmetric property), and
if a = b and b = c then a = c (transitive property).

2.Group (mathematics) ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics) )
*******************
In mathematics, a group is a set equipped with a binary operation that combines any two elements to form a third element in such a way that four conditions called group axioms are
satisfied, namely closure, associativity, identity and invertibility. One of the most familiar examples of a group is the set of integers together with the addition operation, 
but groups are encountered in numerous areas within and outside mathematics, and help focusing on essential structural aspects, by detaching them from the concrete nature 
of the subject of the study.

2.1. Closure
*******
For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G.[b]

2.2. Associativity
******************
For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c).

2.3. Identity element
*********************
There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. Such an element is unique, 
and thus one speaks of the identity element.

2.4. Inverse element (https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Inverse_of_Group_Product)
********************
For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted a−1 (or −a, if the operation is denoted "+"), such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity element.
